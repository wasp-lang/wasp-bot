/**
 * When building wasp in CI, each build usually starts with a clean disk.
 * While we detect most CI environments in our telemetry, we can't detect 100% of them.
 * In case when we don't, and since they start with a clean disk so user signature that
 * telemetry stores in tmp files does not persist, we get a lot of events where each one
 * looks like it was made by new user (while each one is really just another CI run).
 * What is typical for such situations however is that often such CI server will run from the persistent IP,
 * especially if homecooked (which is normally when we might not recognize it as CI).
 * Therefore, what we do here is detect bursts of events from same IP but from different users
 * and then ensure those events are marked as CI so they don't show as false positive
 * new users.
 *
 * This is not perfect, and we may wrongly mark some valid events this way, for example
 * if multiple people from the same place created Wasp projects (imagine classroom),
 * or if dynamic IP address got switched from one to another Wasp user and they used it
 * one after another, but these are rare cases and for now it seems to work quite well
 * in practice -> it removes those bursts that we detected and doesn't seem to cut the
 * normal looking events too much in general.
 *
 * @param events List of all events, sorted from oldest to newwest.
 * @returns Events from input but some of them newly marked as CI (in their context).
